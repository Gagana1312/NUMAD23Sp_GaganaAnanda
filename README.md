# Android Application (Basic operations)

This README provides an overview and setup guide for the Android App project developed in Android Studio. This app demonstrates various Android development concepts including button interactions, Toast messages, threading, RecyclerView for displaying a list, and accessing device location with permissions.

## Features

- **Toast Message Button**: Displays a simple message to the user in a Toast.
- **Alphabet Clicks**: Implements buttons for each letter of the alphabet, showcasing button interactions.
- **Thread System**: Demonstrates the use of threading to perform background tasks without affecting the UI thread.

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine using Android Studio's.
2. **Open the Project**: Open Android Studio, select `Open an Existing Project`, and navigate to the project directory.
3. **Sync Gradle**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly synced by running the Gradle sync.
4. **Configure Permissions**: For the longitude and latitude display feature, ensure the manifest contains the necessary permissions and that you handle runtime permission requests according to Android guidelines.

## Running the App

To run the app, connect your Android device or use the AVD (Android Virtual Device) manager to start an emulator. Then, run the app through Android Studio by clicking on the `Run 'app'` button.
